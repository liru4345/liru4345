## Featured Projects

Below are selected projects that highlight my technical experience and areas of focus:

### 1. movie-mates

A full-stack web application designed to help users discover movies, share opinions, and connect through social features like watchlists, posts, comments, and real-time messaging.

- **Project Overview:** Built a responsive, Instagram-style movie app enabling users to track favorite films, write reviews, and interact with friends.
- **Objectives:** Enhance movie discovery through community-driven recommendations and provide a safe, engaging space for movie discussion.
- **Methodology:** 
  - Developed the frontend using HTML, CSS and JS and handlebars framework.
  - Implemented the backend using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, with session-based authentication and RESTful API design.
  - Enabled real-time chat with Socket.IO and integrated secure image uploads via `multer`.
- **Key Features:**
  - Watchlist management and post feed with public/private visibility
  - Follow/unfollow system with approval notifications
  - Commenting, liking, and messaging between users

### 2. minigit

A simplified, C++-based version control system inspired by Git, designed to help users manage file changes locally through a custom set of core commands.

- **Project Overview:** Built a command-line tool that supports essential version control operations such as `init`, `add`, `remove`, `commit`, and `checkout`, simulating core Git functionality.
- **Objectives:** Gain a deeper understanding of file versioning systems, dynamic memory management, and data structures through hands-on implementation of a minimal Git-like system.
- **Methodology:**
  - Implemented core data structures:
    - **Doubly linked list** for tracking commit history.
    - **Singly linked list** to manage files within each commit.
    - **Hash table** for storing and retrieving commit metadata efficiently.
  - Designed file system interactions to track modified files and generate versioned snapshots.
- **Key Features:**
  - Version control operations: `add`, `remove`, `commit`, `checkout`, and `init`
  - `printLog` to visualize commit history
  - `search` and `help` commands for enhanced usability
